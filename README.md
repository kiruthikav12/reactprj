2ND YEAR REACT JS PROJECT

Project Overview Welcome to the Job Board Listings project! This React.js application was developed as part of a second-year project to create a dynamic and user-friendly platform for job seekers and employers. The application allows users to browse and search for job listings, view detailed job descriptions, and apply for positions directly through the platform. Employers can post job openings, manage their listings, and review applications. The project leverages modern React.js features such as hooks and context API to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience. It also integrates with a backend API to handle data storage and retrieval. This project demonstrates proficiency in React.js, state management, component-based architecture, and RESTful API integration.
